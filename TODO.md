# TODO List for Product Edit Feature Implementation

## Completed
- Updated `src/components/Admin/ProductForm.tsx` to support editing existing products, games, and services.
  - Added `edit` and `initialData` props.
  - On submit, updates existing record if `edit` is true, otherwise inserts new record.
  - Form UI updates to reflect edit mode (title, button text, success message).
- Fixed `src/components/Admin/ProductList.tsx` to correctly handle onEdit callback for viewing/editing products.
- Verified `src/components/Admin/AdminDashboard.tsx` integrates edit mode with ProductForm and ProductList components.

## Next Steps
- Test the admin dashboard UI to ensure editing existing products works as expected.
- Fix any bugs or UI issues found during testing.
- Optionally, add validation or user feedback improvements.
