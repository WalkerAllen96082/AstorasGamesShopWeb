# SPA Routing Fix - Progress

## Completed
- [x] Added _redirects file for Netlify deployment
- [x] Added serve script for local SPA testing
- [x] Reverted vite.config.ts to stable configuration
- [x] Started dev server for testing

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test dev server routing (navigate to /games, /products, etc. and refresh)
- [ ] Test production build with serve (npm run build && npm run serve)
- [ ] Verify Netlify deployment with _redirects

## Notes
- Dev server should handle SPA routing automatically
- Use `npm run serve` for local production testing instead of `npm run preview`
- _redirects file handles routing for Netlify deployment
- Dev server is running on http://localhost:5173
